# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

 
 

## Description 

 
 

- The Prework-study-guide is part of the preparation for the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development offered by EdX and Trilogy Education Services.  

- This project build was to help me understand and prepare for the concepts that i would learn in the initial weeks of the course. This was more of a primer to introduce me to coding.  

- The Prework provides structured learning exercises that expose students to the new concepts and works with repetition and examples to reinforce learning.  

- New concepts are built upon by repetition and review of older code and live experimentation which gives a fuller flavour of the process of code development.  

- The prework introduced me to coding using HTML, CSS and js and more importantly taught me to start to think more like a coder understanding the process of trial and error and the process of testing and posting code for review in teams. Though there was no need to share with teams on github at this stage it is an important learning step to understand the process of iterations in code development.      

-The process is quite intensive due to the Bootcamp approach to fast and intense work but is a useful approach when trying to get people up to speed quickly.  

-The time commitments in this course are however quite intense given most people on this course will most likely be in full time employment. 

 
 

## Usage 

 
 

This process taught me how to use coding to star work on templates, html for bare bones basics and CSS to use selectors and js to develop it further to  

use the Dev Console on Chrome.   

 
 

Th prework-study-guide is split into a number of sections covering everything taught in this section from HTML, CSS< Js, Git and Readme. 

 
 

Each sections outlines the lessons learnt, code developed and the learning outcomes achieved in the form of repos on Github.
